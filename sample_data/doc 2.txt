a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
