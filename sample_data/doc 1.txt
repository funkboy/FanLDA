i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
